### **Q1. What is the Linux Kernel? Explain the Versioning System Used in Linux Kernel Releases. What Are the Major Changes in Each Major Release?**

#### **What is the Linux Kernel?**
The **Linux Kernel** is the core component of the Linux operating system. It directly interacts with the system hardware, manages resources, and serves as a bridge between hardware and software.

---

#### **Key Features of the Linux Kernel**
1. **Hardware Abstraction**: Provides a unified way to interact with different hardware devices.
2. **Process Management**: Manages process scheduling and execution.
3. **Memory Management**: Handles RAM allocation and virtual memory.
4. **Device Drivers**: Allows easy communication between hardware and applications.
5. **Networking**: Provides TCP/IP stack support for communication.

---

#### **Linux Kernel Versioning System**
The Linux kernel follows a versioning format: **X.Y.Z[-extra]**
- **X**: Major version (e.g., `5` for Linux 5.x).
- **Y**: Minor version, introducing new features and updates.
- **Z**: Patch version, containing bug fixes.
- **Extra**: Optional suffix for pre-releases like `-rc1` (release candidate).

#### **Version Example**
```plaintext
Version: 5.15.0
- Major Version: 5
- Minor Version: 15
- Patch Version: 0
```

#### **Major Kernel Versions and Changes**
| **Version** | **Release Year** | **Major Updates**                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2.x**     | 1996–2003         | Introduced SMP (multi-core support), USB, and ext2/ext3 file systems.             |
| **3.x**     | 2011–2015         | Improved scalability, introduced ext4 as the default file system.                |
| **4.x**     | 2015–2019         | Added live kernel patching and eBPF for system performance optimization.         |
| **5.x**     | 2019–2023         | Introduced WireGuard VPN, energy-efficient improvements, and modern GPU drivers. |
| **6.x**     | 2023–Present      | Enhanced ARM64 and RISC-V support, improved memory management.                   |

### **Q2. Enlist the Points in the Boot Process of a Linux System Using systemd**

The Linux **boot process** describes the series of events occurring when a computer starts up.

---

#### **Steps in the Boot Process**
1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**:
   - Hardware components are initialized.
   - POST (Power-On Self-Test) is performed.
   - Bootloader is located and executed.

2. **Bootloader Execution**:
   - The bootloader (e.g., GRUB) loads the Linux kernel and initramfs into memory.
   - Allows users to select a specific kernel or recovery mode.

3. **Kernel Initialization**:
   - The kernel initializes all hardware devices and mounts the root filesystem.
   - The `systemd` process is started as PID 1.

4. **systemd Initialization**:
   - systemd replaces older init systems like SysV.
   - Targets are loaded based on the required state (e.g., multi-user or graphical mode).

5. **Execution of Unit Files**:
   - Unit files control services, sockets, mounts, and timers.
   - Examples:
     - `network.service` to initialize network interfaces.
     - `apache2.service` to start the Apache webserver.

6. **System Ready**:
   - systemd completes all configurations, and the system is fully operational.

---

#### **Example Output of `systemctl`**
```bash
aftab@linux:~$ systemctl list-units
```
```plaintext
UNIT                         LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
basic.target                 loaded active active  Basic System
multi-user.target            loaded active active  Multi-User System
apache2.service              loaded active running The Apache HTTP Server
network.service              loaded active running Network Service
```

### **Q3. What Do You Understand by a Linux Distribution? Enlist 5 Commonly Used Linux Distributions and Their Base Purpose.**

#### **What is a Linux Distribution?**
A **Linux Distribution (distro)** is an operating system built on the Linux kernel and includes a combination of:
- Core utilities (GNU tools).
- Software package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`).
- Optional GUI environments (e.g., GNOME, KDE).

| `/boot`       | 500 MB     | Contains bootloader files and kernel images.                               |
| `/` (root)    | 20 GB      | Primary filesystem for essential binaries and system files.                |
| `/var`        | 10–20 GB   | Stores logs, cache, and spool files.                                        |
| `/srv`        | 50–100 GB  | Dedicated to hosting website files (e.g., `/var/www/html`).                |
| `/tmp`        | 5–10 GB    | Temporary files created by applications.                                   |
| Swap          | 2× RAM     | Virtual memory to ensure stability under high loads.                       |
